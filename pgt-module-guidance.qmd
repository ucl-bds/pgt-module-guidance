Here, we aim to provide guidance to which module is right for you at the moment. This guidance is automated, and depends on your answers to the questions below. This is not an exam, and your answers are not recorded. There are no right or wrong answers for the purpose of suggesting a module. As we don't record answers, in requesting a switch to a more advanced level module, please save your answers and the provided guidance by printing this page to pdf (or take a screenshot if that does not work).

By answering the questions below, we will provide you with automated guidance. This should not be taken as definite, as individual cases vary. The questions relate to four areas (interests, prior training, experience, and ability) and for each of these, your answers will be used to determine a level. 

1. Which module is the default in your programme?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof default_module = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["Fundamental module","fundamental"],
    ["Intermediate module", "intermediate"],
    ["Advanced module","advanced"]
  ] 
))
```

2. Which module are you most interested in taking?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof interest = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["Fundamental module","fundamental"],
    ["Intermediate module", "intermediate"],
    ["Advanced module","advanced"]
  ] 
))
```

3. How would you rate your technical/numerical ability (on a scale between 0 = very poor, and 100 = very good)?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof self_rating = Inputs.range([0,100], {step: 1}, {value: 0})
```

4. How would you rate your coding/programming ability (on a scale between 0 = very poor, and 100 = very good)?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof self_rating_coding = Inputs.range([0,100], {step: 1}, {value: 0})
```

5. How much prior statistics education have you had?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof education = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["None",0],
    ["Some (e.g. a single undergraduate statistics module or online course)",1],
    ["Medium (e.g. two undergraduate statistics modules or online courses)",2],
    ["Extensive (e.g. more than 2 undergraduate statistics modules or online courses)",3]
  ] 
))
```

6. When did you last receive statistics training?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof education_when = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["Never",0],
    ["More than 10 years ago",1],
    ["Between 3 and 10 years ago",2],
    ["Between 3 and 1 years ago",3],
    ["Within the last year",4]
  ]
))
```

7. Which analyses have you learned about?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof analyses_learned = Inputs.checkbox(new Map(
  [
    ["Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA)",2],
    ["Bivariate (or simple) regression",1],
    ["Correlation",1],
    ["Factor analysis",3],
    ["Linear mixed-effects models",3],
    ["Logistic regression",2],
    ["Multiple regression",2],
    ["Multivariate analysis-of-variance (MANOVA)",3],
    ["Bivariate or simple regression",1],
    ["Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)",3],
    ["t-test",1]
  ]
))
```

8. Which analyses have you used in practice?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof analyses_used = Inputs.checkbox(new Map(
  [
    ["Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA)",2],
    ["Bivariate (or simple) regression",1],
    ["Correlation",1],
    ["Factor analysis",3],
    ["Factorial analysis-of-variance (ANOVA)",2],
    ["Linear mixed-effects models",3],
    ["Logistic regression",2],
    ["Multiple regression",2],
    ["Multivariate analysis-of-variance (MANOVA)",3],
    ["Repeated-measures ANOVA",3],
    ["Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)",3],
    ["t-test",1]
  ]
))
```

9. Which statistical software have you used?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof software_used = Inputs.checkbox(new Map(
  [
    ["JAMOVI","click"],
    ["JASP","click"],
    ["Matlab","language"],

    ["R","R"],
    ["SAS","script"],
    ["SPSS","click"],
    ["STATA","script"],
    ["other","other"]
  ]
))
```

10. If $Y = b \times X$, and $b=2$ and $X=3$, what is the value of $Y$?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof algebra_1 = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["1",0],
    ["3",0],
    ["4",0],
    ["6",1],
    ["9",0]
  ]
))
```

11. If $Y = a + b \times X$, then $X$ equals 
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| panel: input
viewof algebra_2 = Inputs.radio(new Map(
  [
    ["Y",0],
    ["a/b",0],
    ["(Y-a)/b",1],
    ["a + b × Y",0],
    ["b × Y",0]
