A switch to a module on a higher level can be requested by you. It will always require approval by the programme director. The deadline for switching modules is the end of induction week. This ensures you don't miss vital teaching. The pace of the modules is high and it will be difficult to catch up when you missed initial content. Changes to modules are not possible past the end of the first week of teaching.

The procedure for switching modules is as follows:

1. Read the "About the statistics modules" page carefully 
2. Complete the questions in the "Module guidance" page and save your answers and the provided advice by printing that page to pdf
3. Contact Hannah Spikesley via [email](mailto:h.spikesley@ucl.ac.uk). State your PGT programme and the module you would like to switch to. Also include your saved answers and advice.
4. Hannah will contact your Programme Director to arrange discussion of your request.
5. Your Programme Director will confirm to Hannah whether you can switch and if so, your request is processed. 
Note that you only need to complete these steps if you want to switch to a module
